## Basic project setup - Scroll to <ins>Part 4</ins> to see all download resources in order

### Part 1 - General Setup Notes

- Unity and GitHub can get pretty bulky. Be prepared to use around **20 GB** of disk space.
- You can ask Sreekar and maybe Ashwath for help if you need it
- (**Important**) You need a <ins>good internet connection</ins> to do this (No McDonalds Wi-Fi)
- You might want popcorn or something while this stuff installs

### Part 2 - GitHub Setup
You might think you already finished setting up GitHub if you can read this page. **<ins>WRONG!!!</ins>**

1) (Optional but **highly recommended**) Download and install <ins>GitHub Desktop</ins> (https://desktop.github.com/download). You better know how to set it up if you're in this team (jk).
2) Download and install <ins>Git</ins> (https://git-scm.com/downloads). If you use Windows you probably need `Git for Windows/x64 Setup`. Don't worry, the linked page isn't a virus; it just looks like that because an old guy made it. I won't blame you if you need a tutorial to set it up.

3) In GitHub Desktop, after you login, press the `Current Repository` dropdown. Then press `Add` --> `Clone Repository`, and you should see one called <ins>Project-ASTRA</ins>. Select it, choose a path to download a copy, and press the blue `Clone` button.

4) After it finishes, keep the file path to the repository handy for <ins>Part 3</ins>. Congrats, you can move on to the last step!


### Part 3 - Unity Setup
1) Download & install <ins>Unity Hub</ins> (https://unity.com/download). It might take a while, so go to <ins>Step 2</ins> in the meanwhile
2) (_After Step 1_) Download & install the correct <ins>Unity Editor</ins> version (https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/6000.0.33). Let it open Unity Hub. Make sure to have `Web Build Support` and <ins>`Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022`</ins> checked in the `Add Modules` page and press `Install`. It takes a really long time, so do <ins>Step 3</ins> and <ins>**touch grass**</ins> or something while it downloads and installs. <ins>**DON'T LET YOUR COMPUTER SLEEP OR IT WILL MAKE YOU REDO THE INSTALLATION!**</ins>
3) Create a Unity account (https://login.unity.com/en/sign-up).
4) (_After Step 2_) Go to `Projects` page with navbar to the left side of Unity Hub. Click `Add` --> `Add project from disk`.
5) Navigate to the parent folder of the GitHub repository (refer to <ins>Part 1</ins> and select it).
6) Press on the project name and open up the project. It might take a while, but after that, <ins>**you're done!!!**</ins>
